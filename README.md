The Hatchers website, branded as ChickBloom, is a front-end project designed to represent a modern hatchery business online. The website showcases a range of features including chick care services, high hatch success rates, expert consultation, and timely delivery. It visually explains the entire hatchery process from egg selection and disinfection to incubation, hatching, vaccination, packaging, and delivery. The site includes a detailed product section that highlights various types of hatching equipment available for purchase, from small-scale incubators to fully automated hatchers. An interactive gallery presents key technologies and setups used in the hatchery, while a chick care and feeding guide provides valuable post-hatch advice for new and existing poultry farmers. Testimonials from satisfied clients help build trust and authenticity. This project uses HTML and CSS and is structured to be responsive and visually engaging, making it suitable for future expansion into a fully functional e-commerce or farm-support platform.
